There were two sources of data in this work. Wikipedia data is available under under the Creative

All models used were accessed either by (paid) public API (\emph{GPT3.5}) or are open source models (\emph{FlanT5}, \emph{BERT}, \emph{BERTGraph}). The models were used in accordance with the terms of service of the respective providers. 

Potential risks of this work include the contribution to the desire for ever-more-powerful large language models, whose training and deployment can have negative consequences on the environment.

Github Copilot was used in writing code for this paper, but all code was reviewed and edited by the authors. The authors are responsible for the content of the paper and the code used in the experiments.
