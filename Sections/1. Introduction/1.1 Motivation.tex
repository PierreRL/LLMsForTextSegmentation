\subsection{Motivation}

% Topic segmentation can be important as a pre-processing step before some other NLP task, or can be important in its own right. 

Tasks such as information retrieval, long-document summarisation and classification can all benefit from first being broken down by topic. For many open source or resource-constrained models, context windows limit the size of input. Although context windows can be increased~\cite{ExtendingContextWindows} and newer models have long context windows, LLMs do not fully utilise long context windows~\cite{EffectOfLongContextWindows,ContextAffectsFactual}.

Furthermore, segmentation can be imporant for its own sake. One might use segments to generate a contents page for a long document or create summaries of parts of a document. Alternatively, one might use segmentation to break down a long document into smaller parts for a user to read or as input in RAG~\cite{RAG}, in which the model must generate an answer to a question based on a segment of text.

% Our application of interest is to use topic segmentation as both a pre-processing step for a document understanding pipeline and as an important step in its own right. This pipeline is used to extract structured information from unstructured text, and the segmentation step is used to break down the document into smaller, more manageable parts. When presented to a user, only semantically self-contained sections of a long document are presented to a user, which can be more easily understood and acted upon.
