Previous methods of topic segmentation use either lexical or semantic similarity, and a variety of different machine learning approaches. However, there has been no research into the usage of LLMs for topic segmentation. LLMs have been shown to be effective at a variety of NLP tasks due to their vast general knowledge of language, a skill which is also required for topic segmentation.
