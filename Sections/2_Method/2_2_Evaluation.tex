\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation}

We follow the work of \citet{fournier-2013-B} who propose the `boundary similarity' metric and associated precision/recall. The metric pairs segment boundaries between a hypothesised and references segmentation. Exact matches score 1 and no match scores 0, whilst matches within a distance $n$ score linearly in the distance. Boundary similarity (B) is the mean score, while boundary precision/recall (BP/BR) are the mean score of matched hypothesis/reference boundaries, respectively. For further justification for the use of boundary similarity as opposed to more traditional metrics such as WD and Pk~\cite{HearstW2002}, see the work of \citet{fournier-2013-B}, or our own investigations\footnote{redacted to retain anonymity}.
