    \caption{The overlapping and recursive prompting strategy for segmentation. In (a), a long document is split into overlapping sections with sentence boundaries enumerated. In (b), each section is segmented by the LLM. In (c), the segments are joined. Finally, in (d), each segment is validated to ensure it is not too long or too short.}~\label{fig:diagram}
